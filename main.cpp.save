/*This is a prototype of a possible machine that could
replace Mcdonald's Workers at the drinks/soft ice/soup section.
The Idea is based in collecting the orders and theorize the time to serve them.
With a full Machine setup we could make all orders take the same amount
of time and exclude any human mistake like unfrozen ice cream or poorly
made sandwiches because of the overload of orders */
